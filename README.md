SIP Investment Analysis Using Advanced Algorithms
Overview

This project implements various algorithms to compute the maximum return on investment (ROI) for a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). It explores multiple algorithmic approaches, including Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Greedy Algorithms, and Divide and Conquer, to find the optimal investment strategy.

Features

Dynamic Programming: Computes the maximum return by considering previous SIP amounts in an optimal way.

Graph Algorithms: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible investments and maximize returns.

Greedy Algorithm: Takes a simple approach by maximizing returns month-by-month.

Divide and Conquer: Uses a max subarray sum algorithm to find the optimal investment trajectory.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas: For reading and processing SIP data from CSV files.

Dynamic Programming: To find optimal investment strategy.

Graph Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore investment options.

Greedy Algorithms: For a simple, efficient approach to maximize returns.

Divide and Conquer: To handle subarray sum calculations for optimal investments.
